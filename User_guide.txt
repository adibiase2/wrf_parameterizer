Parameterizer v. 2.7

Introduction
#########################



Howdy.  The Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model is a mesoscale weather forecasting tool developed by NCAR.  
It has been adapted to add a wildfire modeling component, integrating dynamic wind patterns to fire behavior.  
This tool is the first of several developed as a 'WRF Enhancement Suite', a toolkit designed to make running 
and visualizing the model significantly easier for users.  

This tool is designed to optimize the preprocessing 
of the WRF model, which usually requires a slightly obtuse method of defining a series of domains in a bash 'name list' .
  Using geospatial technology greatly improves the process, and allows a user to actually visualize where the model is running.  
This 'parameterizer' tool can be used to quickly and easily develop a name list.wps that can easily be input into the WRF 
Preprocessing Suite.

The tool takes the form of a .esriaddin file, which can be imported to ESRI ArcMap v10 in seconds, 
ready to use.

Usage
##########################



The parameterizer toolkit was developed to be easy to use, and actually requires no data to use.

Here is the general 
workflow of the process, followed by a detailed step-by-step guide:

Select data resolution -> create a domain -> 
iterate until all domains are made -> define nesting attributes -> select geographic data -> select output location ->
 print out the name list




1) First select the resolution of the first domain (in terms of m^2) in the 'Set Domain Resolution' 
box. You can choose one of the selections or choose your own resolution.  
        
 ***As a caveat: the resolution should be an integer value, and should probably be divisible by        
          
ten (like 9000, 3000, etc.)



2) Load a baseman from ESRI.  You can also use your own map, as long as it's in a projected coordinate system. 


 
3) Click the 'create domain' button and drag your cursor to create a domain.  You will be prompted to save it 
(for instance, as 'domain.img'



4) Keep on defining domains until you're bored (or your study area is appropriately covered at all the scales you want).   
You can change the domain resolution for each successive domain (to keep the WRF gods happy, the nest resolution should 
be a ratio of either 3 or 5 to the parent (so from 3000 to 1000, or 600).



5) After all your domains are created, calculate the nest attributes by clicking the 'calculate nest' button.  
This is easier than it sounds.  Just click the 'calculate nest' button and you'll be prompted to select FIRST the 
master domain (the first domain that contains all the others), and then a nest.   Click the button again until all 
domains are added to the list.  
      **again: select the MASTER and then each nest, each time selecting first the 
master domain and then each separate nest IN ORDER of nesting.  So you'd first select the master, then a nest, then
 repeat the process selecting a different nest each time.
     

NOTE: as each nest is added, the tool will print out the nest attributes in the python interpreter in ArcGIS



6) Click the buttons defining the location of the static geographic data (in WRF this would be .../WPS/geog,  but 
in this context just choose a directory).   

7) Also click the button to choose a location for your namelist.wps to be print out



8) Select the number of domains you've included/created using the 'Number of Domains' option.



8) Now that your domains are created and input into the function, you can now print out the name list (it will be saved 
in your selected output directory). So- this is pretty easy.  For each domain you have, you'll be prompted to select 
the 'parent' and 'nest'- just select those in order.  The name list will be saved to your desired directory.  
   
 ***So this is different than what you do in #5.  Here, starting with the master, you want to select each parent, 
and then the nest.  Then for the next iteration, the 'nest' becomes the parent for the next nest.  
In this way, you'll basically select the all domains in order




###############################
Examples
###############################


So - let's just make a fake scenario for fun to show how this thing works.

Say you make four domains (at 9000, 3000, 1000, 
and 200 meters in resolution). Say these are called 1, 2, 3, and 4.

So for the NEST ATTRIBUTE button, you'd select things 
in this order:
------> 1, 2 then 1, 3 then 1, 4


This is really just a fancy way of appending the attributes of the nests to a list.

For the PRINT FINAL button, you'd select 
things in THIS order:
------> 1, 2 THEN 2, 3 THEN 3, 4

Because this case allows for relative ratios and other fun stuff to be
 calculated.

Hope that makes it easier to figure it out!
